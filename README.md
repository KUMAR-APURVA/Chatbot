# Chatbot
In this project, we have created a Chatbot for Data Structures and Algorithm using NLP and Neural Networks in jupyter notebook.


# Setup
If you want to run the already trained model, download the full folder and run the 'Chatbot using NLP and DNN.ipynb'. 
If you want to train the model again, delete the three model.tflearn files, delete the checkpoint and run the above file again. 


# Requirements
Three main python libraries required are nltk, tensorflow and tflearn.
